## Reflections on "Support Tools Creativity" by Ben Shneiderman

Shneiderman's framework of *Collect-Relate-Create-Donate* and *8 tasks* to support creativity provide more tangible ways of analysis and evaluation of the works in the field. He provides various examples from diverse domains, resulting in a versatile system. 

I really liked the fact that he sees the value in sequences of tasks, and making them seamless to the user. The "annotate-consult-revise" is ubiquitous in Google Docs, "collect-explore-visualize" is used by data analysts every day. 

His 8 task system ends with the *Dissemination* phase; to release our results back to the world so that other people can *Collect* our work either for inspiration or for reference. Even though this phase is trivial, I realized that most of my work lacks exactly this phase.
