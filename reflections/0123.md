# Reading Reflection: January 23rd

For my master's project, I have collaborated with a colleague who lives in the UK. Obviously the spatial dimension was the most prominent barrier for the work. When we could physically meet and work together, our efficiency spiked up really fast. We used video conferencing software to talk, and version control software (Git) to share our work. We started using a private repository in the early stages of development. Ultimately, since the code was already in a cloud service, we released the code to the public as open-source. As Fischer mentions, open-source collaboration enabled more visibility and some contribution to our system.

## Social Creativity: Turning Barriers into Opportunities for Collaborative Design

temporal  :  across time

conceptual : across different communites of practice

technological : between persons and artifacts (requires knowledge-based, domain-oriented systems)

### Social Creativity

- most individuals benefit from interaction and collaboration

- Creativity does not happen inside people's heads, but in the interaction between a person's thoughts and a socio-cultural context

### spatial dimensions

*Barriers* : Open source software communities provide an example of successful collaboration on a large scale mediated by computational media

*Opportunities* : shared concerns, more people involvement

*Exploitation* : informed participation, not bound by location

### temporal dimension 

*Barriers* : duration of the project and people involved in it. 

### conceptual dimension
