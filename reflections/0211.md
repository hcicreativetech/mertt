# Reading Reflection: February 11th

The Makey Makey (which we experimented with in the previous class) is a technology for making user interfaces. Using the Makey Makey as an example, discuss its benefits and limitations as a prototyping technology and as a technology for conducting research through design. Compare your evaluation of the Makey Makey with how prototyping and research through design are presented in the respective readings.
