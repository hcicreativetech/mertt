# Reading Reflection: February 13th

Both readings center on the challenges of understanding (or empathizing) with the experience of others. They communicate fundamental limitations in the ways in which designers can effectively empathize with those outside their own experience. How do these challenges align with your own experiences in creative production or collaboration? Are there scenarios in which you have felt unable to understand the experience of a person you were designing for or working with? Alternatively, how have your own experiences biased you towards valuing some forms of knowing or production over others?
