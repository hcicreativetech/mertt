# Reading Reflection: February 13th

Both readings center on the challenges of understanding (or empathizing) with the experience of others. They communicate fundamental limitations in the ways in which designers can effectively empathize with those outside their own experience. How do these challenges align with your own experiences in creative production or collaboration? Are there scenarios in which you have felt unable to understand the experience of a person you were designing for or working with? Alternatively, how have your own experiences biased you towards valuing some forms of knowing or production over others?




## The Promise of Empathy: Design, Disability, and Knowing the “Other”

- empathy-building

- designers (as the empathizers) position their work to address the experiences of people with disabilities (as the empathized

- "be with" someone, not "be like" -- shift from transferred to shared experiences

- definitions in HCI
	- find ways to immerse yourself in your audiences environment
	- empathy map: synthesize intended users' behaviors feeligns and thoughts
	- Wright and McCarthy [[99]] identify empathy as an emerging trend within HCI studies involving attempts to more deeply understand and interpret user experiences

- disability simulation: "Dialogue in the Dark"
	- makes accessibility guidelines more relevant
	
### critiques to empathy

- empathy directs designers to individuals, not societies or communities

- simulations produce negative stereotypes

- other premises: compassion, humility, noticing

- empathy can open connections while predisposing the empathized as different and other

### DISPATCHES FROM INDUSTRY

Simulation
	- voting booth design case study with blind citizen, comprimises 

	- final machine is accessible to various disabilities

Personas:
	- Adapt-o-Pack game: pick an industry and a (disabled )persona; adapt the industry for individual's needs
	
	- encourages thinking outside their own experience

### slipperiness of empathy

- invisibility of disabled people is a problem, need people with anmes

### Rendering Designers as Nondisabled and People with Disabilities as Nondesigners

- the disconnect between the designer and disabled is not ideal

- empathy sustains the very difference that it may seek to overcome

### FROM “BEING LIKE” TO “BEING WITH”
