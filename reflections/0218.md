# Reading Reflection: February 18th

Oftentimes when an 'expert' approaches a problem, they tend to intuitively know what to do and work with the constraints and affordances of the specific domain. On the contrary, a 'novice' is driven by personally and socially meaningful experiences, and she experiments and plays with the ideas to deepen her understanding. In some sense, the expert's approach could limit the imagination. Being open to ideas such as tinkering and exploring could present opportunities that seemed impossible or unimaginable at first. 

The results of the post-workshop interview with facilitators at Family Creative Learning demonstrate the dichotomy of "not knowing" and "requiring to know". Maria, as a novice in teaching computing, struggles with not being able to help students enough, and with the help of another colleague, learns that the important thing in the workshop facilitating is not to give ready answers but to encourage finding those answers through experiments and play. In contrast, another facilitator Alex is experienced in software development and can help participants with technical questions. Yet, rather than over-facilitating the project of participants, he finds ways to engage with them in a more exploratory way.


<!--
Both readings present the idea of "not knowing", or removing the notion of "expert" as a key component to facilitating creativity. From your perspective, what are the benefits of putting aside the ideas of "expert" and "novice" in a creative setting? What are the challenges?

### Studying the experiences of facilitators

participants and data collection explanations

### results 

- maria: 
	- spanish speaker
	- teacher
	- limited experience with computing
	- workshop 1:
		- surprised about how open the paretns are
	- workshop 2:
		- she felt frustrated because she couldnt immediately help the parents
	- Pia suggested her to model tinerkering and exploration rather than knowing immediately
	- her notion of teaching shifted from "teacher has to know" to "teacher has to figure out, tinker and play"
	- she connected with parents

- sam:
	- grad student 
	- worked with a family of shy people
