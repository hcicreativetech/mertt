# Reading Reflection: January 14th

Csikszentmihalyi defines the *flow* as an immersive pursuit of happiness, a sense of discovery, transporting the consciousness into new planes of reality, and, in general, *controlling the psychic energy* to drive any desired endeavor. He, by no means, limits himself in domain-specificity. The tennis player example uses sports as the primary area of focus, and it parameterizes the number of elements involved in that moment of flow to two (challenge and skillset). 

An objective study pertaining to the implications of the flow is a daunting challenge. The author takes an analytical approach and investigates the cultural implications on the evolution of the flow; internal, environmental, and social factors that block the flow; hereditary and learned experiences that enable the flow. He concludes that the people who are good at channeling their psychic energy into productive material have some commonalities: "Nonselfconscious individuals or people with a strong direction that is not self-seeking". Even in the worst situation, they analyze their environment, find out workable elements, set purposeful goals, and increase the challenge when the previously set goals are finalized. He defines this as *Autotelic Personality*; "people who are internally driven, and who as such may exhibit a sense of purpose and curiosity".

On the other hand, Schon specifically talks about the design process and methods employed by designers. He argues that the designer is more articulate in her design process than her explanation about her design. He says "[the designer] can best (or only) gain access to their *knowing-in-action* by putting themselves into the mode of doing", i.e. *the flow* of Csikszentmihalyi. In the mode (*flow*) of doing, the designer finds herself in a feedback cycle where she sees, acts (moves, draws, programs, etc.), and sees again. In the meantime, she appreciates parts of the practice, evaluates her design intentions, recognizes unintended actions, and communicates with the rest of the design world. 

Schon also argues that the entirety of this design process is too broad for a computer to mimic. For artificial intelligence to be phenomenologically equivalent to the designers, it needs to accomplish all the tasks listed above with a sense of flow that guides the decisions. Therefore he suggests the best use of an AI in the design should be assisting designers.

I believe both texts provide precious insights on human productivity and creativity and offer approaches targeted towards creativity support tools. Schon's paper inspired me by outlining what is helpful for designers from the stance of software engineering. Ideally, the best use of such a tool is increasing *the flow* of the user. Csikszentmihalyi brilliantly elaborates this level of productivity and engagement.

## Donald A. Schon 
Designing as Reflective Conversation with the Materials of a Design Situation

Author concludes that the practitioners of Artificial Intelligence in design would do better to aim at producing design assistants rather than knowledge systems phenomenologically equivalent to those of designers.

#### Introduction
- designers can best (or only) gain access to their knowing-in-action by putting themselves into the mode of doing; i.e. flow

- Design is a *transaction* : designer responds to the demands and possibilities of a design situation
	- material, creating something
	- realtime feedback, constructs and reconstructs
	- unique to designer; or shared with the community
	- design is a communicative world (communication design)

#### Seeing/Drawing/Seeing
- Design is a sensory endavour as much as it is a mental exercise
- designer sees/ moves/ sees again
- two features of design
	- 1) evaluation of the quality on spatial configuration doesn not depend on the ability to give symbolic description of the rules
	- 2) it is a subjective judgement


#### Conclusion

in order to design like a designer, computer needs to be able to:
	- see/act/see
	- construct marks on a medium
	- appreciation of design quality
	- evaluation of design intentions, set new goals, iterate
	- recognize unintented results
	- store and deploy prototypes
	- communicate with design world

can computer just create the outcome of a design process?
	- would be super narrowly defined chunk, where the design world employed by designer can feasibly be assumed as given and fixed.

how about computer-based design assistant?
	- enhance designer's see/move/see cycle
	- microworlds that extends designers ability to construct and explore them
	- extend repertoire of prototypes, allow better exploration for design transaction

## Csikszentmihalyi - conditions of flow

- control of psychic energy to enter easily into a flow experience

#### Flow activities
- immersive pursuit of happiness
- sense of discovery
- transporting self into new reality/consiousness; thus making it more complex
- balance between challenge and skillsets
	- graph: A1 is less *complex* then A4
- The rules ofgames are intended to direct psychic energy in patterns that arc enjoyable

#### Flow and culture
- objective study pertaining to the culture is a challenge
- "If we assume [...] that the desire to achieve optimal experience is the foremost goal of every human being, the difficulties of interpretation raised by cultural relativism become less severe"
- the pygmies of the Ituri (orest described by Colin Turnbull: 
	- When they are not hunting or improving their villages they sing, dance, play musical instruments, or tell stories to each other
	- Their culture would nOt be given a high rating in terms ofmaterial achievement, but in terms ofproviding optimal experiences their way of life seems to he extremely successful.
- evolution of cultures 
	- When a culture succeeds in evolving a set of goals and rules so
compelling and so well marched to the skills of the population that its members are able to experience flow with unusual frequency and intensity, the analogy between games and cultures is even closer.

#### THE AUTOTELIC PERSONALITY
Autotelic : Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes people who are internally driven, and who as such may exhibit a sense of purpose and curiosity, as autotelic

- blocks the flow:
	- internal:
		- self-centered
		- self-consciousness
		- genetic factors	
		- Attentional disorders and stimulus overinclusion
	- environmental
		- weather
	- social
		- slavery
		- oppression
		- exploitation
		
		- anomie : lack of rules, nobody knows what to expect
			- "People who depend on the rules of society to give order to their consciousness become anxious."
		- Alienation : "people arc constrained by the social system to act in ways that go against their goals."
		
##### Neurophysiology and Flow
- less enjoyable experinece : relying on great deal of external information to form a representation of reality
- more enjoyable experinece : rely less external cues, helps restructure experience easily
- no evidence that shows this difference is hereditary, could be learned through childhood

##### The Effects of the Family on the Autotelic Personality

Autotelic : Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes people who are internally driven, and who as such may exhibit a sense of purpose and curiosity, as autotelic

five factors for autotelic family context
- clarity : knowing expectations of parents and goals
- centering : children's perception that their parents are interested in what they are doing in the present, in their concrete feelings and experiences,
- choice : children feel that they have a variety of possibilities from which to choose, including that of breaking parental rules-as long as they are prepared to face the consequences
- the trust that allows the child to feel comfortable enough to set aside the shield of his defenses, and become unselfconsciously involved in whatever he is interested in
- challenge : the parents' dedication to provide increasingly complex opportunities for action to their children

#### THE PEOPLE OF FLOW
- they survived by finding ways to turn the bleak objective conditions into subjectively controllable experience
	- analyze the environment 
	- set goals, closely monitor progress through constant feedback
	- when reached the goal, up the challenge
	
- When adversity threatens to paralyze us, we need to reassert control by finding a new direction in which to invest psychic energy, a direction that lies outside the reach of external forces
- Richard Logan : He concludes that the most important trait of survivors is a "nonselfconscious individualism," or a strongly directed purpose that is not self-seeking.
- Narcissistic individuals, who are mainly concerned with protecting their self, fall apan when the external conditions turn threatening
