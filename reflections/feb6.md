# Reading Reflection: February 6th

<!--
Resnick and Rosenbaum motivate their principles for tinkerability with regards to the opportunities tinkerable systems provide for learning and education. Discuss how tinkering is or is not relevant to professional practice, or expert-level production.

Resnick and Rosenbaum see tinkering as an opportunity to explore a given subject by willing engagement and experimentation. They list findings based on their experience with tinkerable systems (Scratch and MaKey MaKey). By the nature of the process, tinkering provides a great way for an introduction to discipline as it promotes self-experimentation and learning. It enables people to learn new skills and to reinforce what they already know through empirical evidence that they come up with. In this sense, can tinkering be a useful tool for expert-level production in professional fields? Yes and no.

Tinkering, by its nature, is a process-driven, exploratory practice. On the other hand, professional industries usually require a certain level of certainty given the constraints of time and money. E.g., a car brand wouldn't want to manufacture 1000 fully-functioning design prototypes due to obvious financial and temporal limitations. A group of people comes together to attack a problem, and each individual needs relatively clear instructions to actually realize their part of the job. However, this does not necessarily mean that tinkering cannot be used in this process at all. Some industries use brain-storming or rapid-prototyping before starting a project. The aim here is rarely to learn how to solve a problem, but rather finding creative ways for open exploration. They can tinker with the possible paths for their ultimate result and can adjust the requirements as they go. In this case, their domain expertise would enable them to play with different ideas fluidly and to extrapolate on the iterations to predict their results. 

For example, the article mentions a game developer (EmeraldDragon), who plays with Scratch to learn how to build a game, and then asks for recommendations from the audience to set new goals for the game. This example reminded me of the design process of a new truck from Tesla. While designing the truck, Elon Musk (and probably his team) has continually engaged with the audience on Twitter, collected real-life recommendations from them, and tinkered on the design of the truck by accommodating the best ideas from the community. Here, he is not consulting the community to teach himself how to build a truck, rather he is grabbing design challenges to later work on them.

On the other hand, projects that allow exploration, e.g. research projects, can benefit from tinkering in all its steps. It is common that these projects still have a goal in mind, but it's usually defined less rigidly than the projects in industry with a specific financial burden. In a sense, research becomes almost synonymous to tinkering: "The tinkering [, or *research*,] is characterized by a playful, experimental, iterative style of engagement, in which makers are *continually reassessing their goals, exploring new paths, and imagining new possibilities*" (p. 164).

Tinkering vs iterative design 




## DESIGNING FOR TINKERABILITY

- maker movement : new opportunity for reinvigorating and revalidating the progressive-constructionist tradition in education

- just making for the sake of making is not enough : "tinkering"

- The tinkering approach is characterized by a playful, experimental, iterative style of engagement, in which makers are continually reassessing their goals, exploring new paths, and imagining new possibilities.

- How can we design technologies and activities for tinkerability?

#### WHAT IS TINKERING?

- tinkering is a valid and valuable style of working, characterized by a playful, exploratory, iterative style of engaging with a problem or project
 
- Don Schoen : tinkeres have a conversation with the material

Anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss (1966) describes how people in many parts of the world, acting as *bricoleurs*, continually improvise with currently available materials to build or repair objects in their everyday lives.

- tinkering and **bricolage** is related to play : To us, play is a style of engaging with the world, a process of testing the boundaries and experimenting with new possibilities.

- tinkering is not necesarily physical, key is the style of interaction, not the media and materials

#### WHY IS TINKERING IMPORTANT?

- Success in the future will depend not on what you know, or how much you know, but on your ability to think and act creatively—on your ability to come up with innovative solutions to unexpected situations and unanticipated problems.

- tinkering prioritize creativity and agility over efficiency and optimization

- Turkle and Papert “epistemological pluralism”—that is, respecting and valuing multiple styles of learning and multiple ways of knowing

#### COMPUTATION + TINKERABILITY

- Scratch 
	- you can program your own inter active stories, games, animations, and simulations—then share your creations online
	- EmeraldDragon My Dragon Game (NOT finished), emerged as a tinkering process
		- getting recommendations from user base (Elon Musk, designing CyberTruck??)
- MaKey MaKey
	- a controller that you can attach anything to
	- Anna's process of discovering as she goes
	
#### DESIGNING KITS FOR TINKERABILITY

- Immediate Feedback: Quick response in rapid changes
	- see the results
		- tinkering should be a continuous, ongoing process
		- liveness 
	- see the process
		- what the program doing (execution), and what is its internal state (variables)
	
- Fluid experimentation: inherent iteration
	- easy to get started
		- setup process can hinder experimentation
	- easy to connect
		- connecting different parts of the tinkering system should be easy
		- lego bricks is perfect example

- Open exploration: enable and inspire people to explore possibilities
	- variety of materials
		- possibility of using different media in the process
		- could be animations, sprites, music; or freedom to attach any conductive material in MaKey MaKey
	- variety of genres
		- possibility of making different types of results

#### TINKERING WITH TINKERABILITY

- designing contexts for tinkerability

- key findings:
	- Emphasize process over product: process and failed attempts are also important
	- Set themes, not challenges: give freedom to choose their own challenges based on skill levels
	- highlight diverse examples: show the scope of possibilities
	- tinker with the space: evaluate how to use the space fully
	- Encourage engagement with people, not just materials : collaboration makes it more fun
	- Pose questions, not answers: dont explain too much, encourage stimulating discussions
	- Combine diving in with stepping back: allow time to step back and look at the process
