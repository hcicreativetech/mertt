# An Analysis of Live-Coding Systems
*Mert Toka*
*MAT 594X - Final Project*

### Abstract
This paper analyzes and compares four live-coding systems to find affordances and limitations of each system.   

### Introduction
In its broader definition, live-coding refers to any programming activity that is written and compiled/interpreted almost simultaneously. However, in the recent years, the term started to appear in the context of improvisational music production through real-time programming.     

- 4 systems
  - Gibber [2]
  - SuperCollider [3]
  - TidalCycles [4]
  - Siren [5]

### Background
- the role of algorithms in music production
- creative computing and live-coding 
- rythm and repetition
- patterns
- text-editors / IDEs / CLIs

### Methodology
I compare each system based on the state of the software (Table 1) and their cognitive dimensions for notational systems [1] (Table 2). 

**Table 1:**
||Gibber|SuperCollider|TidalCycles|Siren|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Underlying Programming Language|Javascript|SClang|Haskell|Javascript, SClang, TidalCycles|
|Learning Curve|Moderate|Steep|Easy|Moderate|
|Support for Visual Elements|Full Integration|None|None|Moderate Integration|
|Support for Web Browsers|Online|None|Supports|None|
|Complexity of Installation|Trivial|Easy|Moderate|Hard|
|Robustness|Robust|Fragile|Robust|Robust|

**Table 2:**
All of them or a subset of these? 
|Cognitive Dimension||Gibber|SuperCollider|TidalCycles|Siren|
|--- |------ |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Visibility | How easy is it to view and find elements or parts of the music during editing?|||||
|Juxtaposability|How easy is it to compare elements within the music?|||||
|Hidden Dependencies|How explicit are the relationships between related elements in the notation?|||||
|Hard Mental Operations|When writing music, are there difficult things to work out in your head?|||||
|Progressive Evaluation (Audibility / Liveness)|How easy is it to stop and check your progress during editing?|||||
|Conciseness / Diffuseness|How concise is the notation? What is the balance between detail and overview?|||||
|Provisionality|Is it possible to sketch things out and play with ideas without being too precise about the exact result?|||||
|Secondary Notation |How easy is it to make informal notes to capture ideas outside the formal rules of the notation?|||||
|Consistency |Where aspects of the notation mean similar things, is the similarity clear in the way they appear?||||||
|Viscosity|Is it easy to go back and make changes to the music?|||||
|Role Expressiveness|Is it easy to see what each part is for, in the overall format of the notation?|||||
|Premature Commitment|Do edits have to be performed in a prescribed order, requiring you to plan or think ahead?|||||
|Error Proneness|How easy is it to make annoying mistakes?|||||
|Closeness of Mapping|Does the notation match how you describe the music yourself?|||||
|Abstraction Management|How can the notation be customised, adapted, or used beyond its intended use?|||||
|Virtuosity / Learnability|How easy is it to master the notation? Where is the respective threshold for novices and ceiling for experts?|||||

### Evaluation
An individual investigation of each system will be presented in following sub-sections.
#### Gibber

#### SuperCollider

#### TidalCycles

#### Siren


### Discussion
- compare and contrast different modalities 
  - web
  - visual
  - programming paradigms
- possible guidelines for improved workflows based on the findings

### Conclusion
- potential directions
- summarize results
- opportunity areas for a new/improved software

## Prompt
#### Analyzing Existing Technologies: 

Perform a critical analysis of a field of established creative technologies. Provide evidence for the limitations and opportunities of these technologies and propose concrete directions for future development of alternatives. Your analysis should include the following elements: 

a. A description of the domain of technologies/ tools that you have chosen to focus on.

b. A description of a minimum of 5 exemplar technologies drawn from HCI/ systems research publications or prominent examples used in real-world practice. Note: these can include technologies discussed in class.

c. An exploration of the affordances and qualities of these example technologies that connects their features and constraints to the kinds of things that can be made with them and / or the people who can use them. You may choose to use charts or visualizations to map out this space.

d. A following section that advocates for a new tool or technology that targets a space that has not been explored by the existing tools in your analysis. Note: The new technology you propose in the essay need not be a technology you’re working on (though it could be). Think of this as an exercise in identifying opportunities and articulating the differences between systems, not in describing what you’re actually building.
