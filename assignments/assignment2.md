### Introduction

These interviews aim to gain a better understanding of the individual practices of three colleagues and their approach to collaboration. Investigating their processes informs us how different backgrounds and interests coexists, and how they affect one another. 

### Interview 1

Cindy Kang is a Master's student in Media Arts & Technology at UCSB. She has studied abstract and realistic oil painting and has taken classes relating to composition, architectural drawing, performance art, and installation. Now, she has switched focus to Media Arts and working with the digital medium. 

She describes her approach to oil painting as an exploratory and chaotic practice; an idea pops up in her head and she just does it. Even though she mentions that the practice is chaotic, she feels a certain level of familiarity and grounding when working with analog tools like her paper, brush, paint, and canvas. On the contrary, she establishes a more structured approach when working with digital systems. She identifies problems ahead of time and finds solutions for them. She is having a hard time anchoring herself in a specific digital production tool since the software requirements change drastically faster than the analog medium. 

When it comes to collaboration, she believes complementing each other’s knowledge and skills is crucial. The most comfortable collaboration setting is when she knows what kind of work needs to come from her. She recently had a commission at a science museum in downtown Santa Barbara through a collaborative project. She expressed that the first installation of this project enabled her to value user experience more than her personal aspirations. She enjoys inspiring people with her work; when the audience takes away anything about technology she feels rejuvenated. She finds ‘believing herself’ the most challenging aspect throughout project development. 

### Interview 2

Aaron Anderson is a musician, composer, and audio developer. After his background in composition education, he started his graduate education at UCSB and started focusing on audio programming. He enjoys working with sound the most; he finds the audio field more interesting than visual and tactile paradigms because of its greater temporal resolution and ability to fill the physical space through sound waves. He produces software, compositional audiovisual pieces, and physical products as his artifacts.

Novel approaches are key in his practice. He starts a project by seeing if his idea has already been created and if it needs to be created. Creating algorithms that haven’t been used and making sounds that haven’t been heard before excites him. He only works with materials that he is interested in, and he is trying to refrain from dictating what the end result is going to be. 

He believes big and compelling products require collaboration. He values an emergent common ground in his collaborations. He is currently collaborating on an audio library, and he feels validated when his colleague approves his methods as an engineer. He appreciates expertise when working with other researchers. He finds pure individualism the most challenging part of a team project. His ideal collaboration setting should put the work forward rather than individual egos. He also finds it hard to create enough time for his practice; the fragmented life of his graduate studies makes it harder to dedicate quality time that a project deserves. 

### Interview 3

The last artist I interviewed is Anshul Pendse, a Ph.D. student at UCSB. His background includes computer animation, game design, and interactive media, and his research now focuses on designing immersive experiences. Worldbuilding as a new modality that has positive effects on wellbeing, and eliciting states of trans interests him. 

He identifies his favorite medium as experience building / immersive installations. He believes it proposes a cohesive blend from physical reality to the space of art. It incorporates spatial design and interior design, mixing the digital and physical together. He mostly produces virtual worlds for VR headsets, coupled with a complete environment in the physical space. All of his props and other materials constitute his library of artifacts. Even though he focuses on digital world-building, he mentions a sketchbook and pen at the top of his list when I asked him about his favorite tools. According to Anshul, sketching is the most important component in the ideation phase. It helps articulate the message, grants opportunities to find out the strongest parts of his design. He stresses that the ideas are cheap, the important thing is to be able to work with the constraints and build a prototype. Once he has the first prototype, his user-centric design gradually guides itself towards its final state of the project through countless iterations.

Like Aaron, Anshul also seeks out expertise and wants to learn from the processes of his collaborators. He incorporates his collaborators’ agenda into his vision and tunes the project direction accordingly. He believes that the hardest part of any collaboration is people’s ego and the strongest collaborations originate from genuine conversations outside of the scope of their project. 

He feels rewarded when people experience the therapeutic effects of his immersive experiences. He also feels good when he makes and shares, no matter how small it is. He believes that real happiness comes from within, i.e. the joy of sheer creation, rather than waiting for the validation from outside, that may or may not come. Setting milestones and being diligent following them are the most challenging part of his practice.
