# Understanding the Experience of the Audience in Immersive Art Exhibitions

##### Mert Toka 
##### MAT 594X @ UCSB

This document outlines an evaluation of user-experience in immersive art exhibitions.   

## 1) Introduction

- Immersive art offers a holistic approach to the exhibition by targeting *as many senses as possible*
- It focuses on *the experience of the audience* (interaction, collaboration, communication)
- *The scale* of these spaces varies: They can include anything from a virtual world that lives inside the HMD, to art installations or entire buildings 
- Depending on the scale, *location* can be permanent and the art may change periodically
- Even though some examples use *tangible media* as base materials, most incorporate *digital* to achieve multisensory immersion. 
- *New technologies* plays a central role in the development of these artifacts (projection mapping / VR / AR / AI)

### Problem Statement and motivation

- Similar to task-analysis, experience-analysis is a significant field to HCI research
- Determining key components in the experience is helpful to build a common vocabulary
- ...

**===** what makes the domain and problem worth investigating
  - **===** definition of task and experience

##### Questions
- What are the primary interaction techniques of immersive art exhibitions?
  - What is the ideal number of people that they can host at a given time?
  - How do the participants communicate with each other?
  - How frequently do the audience directly modify the artwork (active participation)? 
  - Do they explore the world collaboratively, or do they enter the world alone?
  - Does the exhibition suggest a trajectory of navigation to participants, or are they completely free to explore the space? 
  
- How do immersive art spaces facilitate social participation?
  - Are there some tasks that the audience is expected to work collaboratively?

- What is the overall experience of the participants?   
  - To what extend immersive art exhibitions play a role in changing the audience's attitude towards art?

Use. In A. Sears & J. A. Jacko (Eds.), The Human-computer Interaction

  - discusses evaluation for an emphasis on content quality, access, and interaction, or context of experience
    - He writes that ―The focus of nearly all evaluation in HCI has been on how well someone can complete a specified task using the technology being evaluated.‖ and proposes the chapter in contrast or addition to this approach. He suggests that HCI professionals need to be able to assist in the design of ―artifacts that provide emotionally satisfying user experiences‖, and suggest we should consider questions like
      - How can we design a user experience that is engaging?
      - How can we measure the social value of a technology?
