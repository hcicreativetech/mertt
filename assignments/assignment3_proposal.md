For my final project, I want to analyze and evaluate immersive art as a practice. Big scale installations of the artifacts usually involve an interdisciplinary team, and, naturally, the collaboration plays a central role. The team uses and develops research in computer graphics, audio, and HCI to deliver their message in the most artful way possible. Identifying the affordances and constraints is crucial for developing an assessment of research component. Some examples that I will investigate are [Meow Wolf](https://meowwolf.com/), [teamLAB](https://www.teamlab.art/), [Moment Factory](https://momentfactory.com/home), and [Flutter Experience](https://flutterexperience.com/). I aim to use existing public data about their engagement with the community, and observations from their visitors. I would also like to find similarities and differences between the commercial world of this practice and the academic community around media arts.
